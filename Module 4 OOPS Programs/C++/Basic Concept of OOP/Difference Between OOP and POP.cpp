//	1)	  Focuses on representing problems as interactions between objects. Objects have state (attributes) and 
//		  behavior (methods), and the emphasis is on data abstraction and encapsulation. 
//		  Programs are designed around classes and objects that interact through well-defined interfaces.
//		  
//	2)    Data and methods (functions) are encapsulated together in objects. Objects manage their own state and 
//	      can interact with other objects through method calls.	
//		   
//	3)	  Languages like Java, Python, C++, and C# are examples of languages that support OOP principles extensively.

//	1)    Focuses on writing procedures or functions that perform operations on data. Programs are typically structured 
//		  around procedures or functions that manipulate data, and data is often stored in structures like 
//		  arrays or structs.
//		  
//	2)    Data and functions are separate. Data is often held in data structures (like arrays or records) and functions operate 
//		  directly on these data structures.
//		  
//	3)	   Languages like C, Pascal, and early versions of BASIC primarily follow procedural programming principles.
